# Crossover

In genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, **crossover**, also called **recombination**, is a genetic operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring.

## Recombination Interface

All recombination operations have following call interface: `recombination(i1, i2)` where `i1` and `i2` are the same type individuals that involved in recombination to produce an offspring. The recombination function returns pair of recombined individuals.

**Note:** Some of the selection algorithms implemented as function closures, in order to provide additional parameters for the specified above recombination interface.
