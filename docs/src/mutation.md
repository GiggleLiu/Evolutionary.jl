# Mutation

In genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, **mutation** is a genetic operator used to maintain a diversity from one generation of a population to the next. It is analogous to biological mutation. Mutation alters one or more gene values in a chromosome from its initial state.
The purpose of mutation is to introduce diversity into the sampled population.

**Note:** All mutations are in-place operations, i.e. they modify a parameter object.
